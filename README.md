# CropRow Detection Dataset

Here we will release the dataset for the submission ([Towards agricultural autonomy: crop row detection under varying field conditions using deep learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08247)) in the ICRA 2022.

---
## Dataset Structure
The dataset is based on 500 base images. The 500 base images are augmented into 2000 sub-images. The 2000 image dataset is classified into two groups for the purpose of testing and training. Each training and testing sub-groups contains 1000 images. Each image in the dataset consists of a corresponding ground truth image. 

Numeric values of the labelled coordinates are stored in *.mat* files. All the label coordinates in train dataset are stored in a single *.mat* file. The label coordinates in test dataset are stored in 10 separate *.mat* files.

## Data Augmentation
Base image is augmented into four sub images by cropping and rotating in different orientations.

## Sample Data
The crop row is labelled with white lines on black background. The line width of the white line is 6 pixels. The labels could be regenerated with custom line width using the labels *.mat* files.
